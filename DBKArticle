with mixed emotions [Article title; note: above 3 columns of text]

• [correction: replace bullet point with double quotation mark] I was shaving in the dorm one
day,* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark] related a Negro boy, ' [correction: replace single quotation mark with double quotation mark] and
I cut myself. A friend who was
sitting nearby joked with me
and said, ‘Gee, I didn’t know you
had red blood. My mother al­
ways told me it was blue.’ * [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
Turning to his friend, the
Negro youth replied, * [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark] Now that
you see it’s red, think of all the
other lies your mother might
have told you."
This is what the Negro some­
times encounters on campus.
But he knows that a jovial return
[note: inserted space]
[Second column]
or a friendly innuendo may serve
to enlighten a white person’s
attitudes and teach him what the
black man is like and what he is
not like.
Negroes on campus who mix
socially and academically with
whites and also stay away from
large associations of Negroes
feel that they are recognized as
students — [correction: insert space] not as •Negro* [note: non-matching punctuation marks] stu­
dents. As rapport develops be­
tween these Negroes and their
white colleagues, race becomes
just another topic for dormitory
bull sessions and jests.

one day plastered Black Power
signs all over their hall. “ft [correction: replace ft with It] was
fun/ [correction: delete forward slash and insert double quotation mark] reports prankster Carolyn [Name],
a freshman from Baltimore [Place name], for
in reply to this stunt, the white
girls “dressed up in paper bags,
pretending they were a (Ku Klux)
Klan [Name of white supremacy group].* [correction: delete asterisk and insert double quotation mark]
The hooded WASPS [Acronym] sprinkled
perfume on the floor in the shape
of a cross and set fire to it. “It
really startled usP [correction: delete P] exclaimed
Carolyn [Name].
• [correction: replace bullet point with double quotation mark] We kid around a lot in the
dorm," related Bronwyn [Name], a junior.
• [correction: replace bullet point with double quotation mark] We sing * [correction: replace asterisk with single quotation mark] We Shall overcome.’ • [correction: replace bullet point with double quotation mark]
Songs and jokes, she says, don’t
offend her, for she does not "look
on the bad side about what other
people say about me."
Some other Negro students find
adjustment to College Park diffi­
cult. Betty [Name], who is 28 years old,
married and a native of Cali­
fornia [Place name], finds an “extremely
hostile* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark] attitude about the
campus. “There are certain
vibrations you can feel.* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
Betty [Name] recalls an incident she
had with an advisor. During
registration week, she went to
him twice with scheduling dilem­
mas. “He was very nasty,* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark] she
recalled, biting her lower lip and
widening her very expressive
eyes. “I told him I had to take
this course. He threw my (drop­
add) slip at me. . .1 [correction: replace 1 with I] thought it
was terribly unprofessional for
an advisor to extend this sort of
treatment.* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
Betty feels that her race did
play a causative factor toward
this discourteous treatment. “I
do have a basis for comparison,* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
she explained. She was raised
in an integrated community, has
traveled through Europe [Place name] with her
husband, attended San Francisco
State College [Name of College] and Hunter College [Name of College]
and interdated in her high school
and earlier college years.

[First column]
• [correction: replace bullet point with double quotation mark] I find It [correction: replace It with it] extremely difficult to estab­
lish any form of communication with
some of the teachers and advisors here,* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
she said. “Students, basically, »ve [correction: are]
friendly, receptive, and warm. Bui [correction: But], in
some instances, there is hesitancy. . . I
don't think they know how to respond to
a Negro.* [replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
Betty [Name] has run into trouble securing
rides from the commuters' carpool serv­
ice. A few times, she was able to arrange
rides over the telephone. However,
when she met her future commuting
companions they would frequently “begin
to make excuses,* [replace asterisk with double quotation mark] and Betty had no
ride.
Resulting from her academic and
social contacts, Betty [Name] concludes that,
“When you are brought up in an Inte­
grated situation, you act as an individual.
You are not Negro or white. But here
... in the South. . . and on this campus
... I feel lam [correction: I am] treading on white man's
territory. . .This is the first time I
feel Negro.* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
Also noting a discernible line between
the races, but holding a different view­
point is a 28 year-old male student who
works full time off campus.
What's so overwhelming about feeling
like a Negro, he questioned. “Isn't
there a distinction* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark] between Negroes and
whites?
With a wholly different frame of mind
is Harry [Name], a lively, congenial sophomore
who commutes to school and takes photo­
graphs for campus publications. “I am
not a Negro on a white campus!* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark] he
asserts.
• [correction: replace bullet point with double quotation mark] I don't think this is a white campus
. . . and I don't go for this stuff that the
Negro doesn’t have as much chance as
everyone else out here. He does.* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
A native of Wisconsin and formerly a
nine-year resident of Little Rock, Ark. [Place name],
Harry [Name] says, “Because of the way my
family brought me up. . .1 [correction: replace 1 with I] have never
felt inferior to anybody. Some Negroes
do feel inferior. Some feel mid way.* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
A Negro who feels cunningly daring is
Dave [Name]. Dave [Name] has skin brown as chocolate,
teeth white as snow and a smile that
signals immediate rapport with his
environment.
“Maryland is a conservative campus,* [replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
he notes. “You can’t very well walk out
of your race. I was told a lot of tales
[note: inserted space]
[Second column]
before I came here. ‘You can’t do this.
You can’t do that.’ I feel, though, that
there is an atmosphere here and an
opportunity to participate in just about
anything.* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
Dave [Name] has been active in dormitory
sports, house rules committee, powder­
puff football, dormitory parties and
homecoming preparations.
Socially, Dave [Name] goes out with whites
and Negroes. “I've gone steady with
white girls, Jewish girls,* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark] he said,
adding, “I guess I am a gregarious
fellow. I interrelate easily.* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark] “But I
use my intellect before I jump. Every­
one gets slapped in the face a few times.
So you use some discretion.* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
In class, for example, “If your grade
is tottering. . . and your prof talks with
a little bit of a Southern accent. . . you
don’t talk to Sally during the lecture.* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
Two female Negro students, however,
disagree with Dave’s [Name] classroom obser­
vation. “If you prove yourself to the
teacher," feels Bronwyn [Name], “there is noth­
ing the teacher can do against you.* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
“I have encountered nothing (prejudi­
cial) whatsoever,* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark] related Kathleen, a
junior majoring in marketing and a
transfer student from the University of
Maryland [Name of College] in Munich, Germany [Place name]. “I have
yet to find an Inkling [correction: replace Inkling with inkling] that such a thing
exists as far as teaching is concerned.* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
Rich [Name], a 26 year-old Business Student
recalls, “There were a couple of courses
I have taken here where I felt I had
gotten a raw deal... I have only run
across two professors I can really sit
down and talk to here in BPA [Acronym].* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
Betty [Name], the attractive housewife-student
from California agrees. “I don’t expect
to get the benefit of the doubt if I am
borderline.* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
Discussing classroom interaction
among students, some Negroes find they
are stared at if race is discussed during
a lecture. Other Negroes notice nothing
of the sort.
• [correction: replace bullet point with double quotation mark] The kids don’t stare at me. They
don’t even look up,* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark] laughed a pretty
Junior who commutes to school from
Laurel [Place]. “If they do, I don’t catch them
staring!* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
“Sometimes it hits me that I am the
only Negro in a class,* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark] relates another
[note: inserted space]
[Third column]
Negro. * [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark] lt [correction: replace lt with It] doesn't make me shrink. I
am always working harder because I
always feel I have to prove myself to
white people. I have to show them that I
live as well as they do, maybe better.
I am not a dumb, ignorant Negro. I feel
that I have to prove this to them,* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
Though the Negroes on campus have
[note: inserted space]
[Fourth column]
different experiences and perceptions to
relate, they generally agree on one com­
mon theme. As one freshman comment­
ed, “When you have more and more
contact with Negro people, then you
don’t have as many preconceptions. Why?
Because the preconceptions all fall
apart.* [correction: replace asterisk with double quotation mark]
