Negroes view campus
with mixed emotions

By HOLLACE GOLDBERG

•I was shaving in the dorm one
day,* related a Negro boy, 'and
I cut myself. A friend who was
sitting nearby joked with me
and said, ‘Gee, I didn’t know you
had red blood. My mother al­
ways told me it was blue.’ *
Turning to his friend, the
Negro youth replied, *Now that
you see it’s red, think of all the
other lies your mother might
have told you."
This is what the Negro some­
times encounters on campus.
But he knows that a jovial return
or a friendly innuendo may serve
to enlighten a white person’s
attitudes and teach him what the
black man is like and what he is
not like.
Negroes on campus who mix
socially and academically with
whites and also stay away from
large associations of Negroes
feel that they are recognized as
students —not as •Negro* stu­
dents. As rapport develops be­
tween these Negroes and their
white colleagues, race becomes
just another topic for dormitory
bull sessions and jests.
Two colored girls in Wicomico
one day plastered Black Power
signs all over their hall. “ft was
fun/ reports prankster Carolyn,
a freshman from Baltimore, for
in reply to this stunt, the white
girls “dressed up in paper bags,
pretending they were a (Ku Klux)
Klan.*
The hooded WASPS sprinkled
perfume on the floor in the shape
of a cross and set fire to it. “It
really startled usP exclaimed
Carolyn.
•We kid around a lot in the
dorm," related Bronwyn, a junior.
•We sing *We Shall overcome.’ •
Songs and jokes, she says, don’t
offend her, for she does not "look
on the bad side about what other
people say about me."
Some other Negro students find
adjustment to College Park diffi­
cult. Betty, who is 28 years old,
married and a native of Cali­
fornia, finds an “extremely
hostile* attitude about the
campus. “There are certain
vibrations you can feel.*
Betty recalls an incident she
had with an advisor. During
registration week, she went to
him twice with scheduling dilem­
mas. “He was very nasty,* she
recalled, biting her lower lip and
widening her very expressive
eyes. “I told him I had to take
this course. He threw my (drop­
add) slip at me. . .1 thought it
was terribly unprofessional for
an advisor to extend this sort of
treatment.*
Betty feels that her race did
play a causative factor toward
this discourteous treatment. “I
do have a basis for comparison,*
she explained. She was raised
in an integrated community, has
traveled through Europe with her
husband, attended San Francisco
State College and Hunter College
and interdated in her high school
and earlier college years.
