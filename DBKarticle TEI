           <head>Negroes view campus with mixed emotions</head>

            <cb n="1"/>
            <byline>By Hollace Goldberg</byline>
          <p> "I was shaving in the dorm one <lb/> day," related a Negro boy, "and <lb/> I cut myself. A friend who was <lb/>
            sitting nearby joked with me <lb/> and said, ‘Gee, I didn’t know you <lb/> had red blood. My mother al-<lb break="no"/>­ways told me
            it was blue.’" <lb/> </p>
          <p> Turning to his friend, the <lb/> Negro youth replied, "Now that <lb/> you see it’s red, think of all the <lb/>
            other lies your mother might <lb/> have told you." <lb/> </p>
          <p> This is what the Negro some­-<lb break="no"/>times encounters on campus. <lb/> But he knows that a jovial return <lb/>

            <cb n="2"/>
              or a friendly innuendo may serve <lb/> to enlighten a white person’s <lb/> attitudes and teach him what the <lb/>
              black man is <lb/> like and what he is not like. <lb/> </p>
          <p> Negroes on campus who mix <lb/> socially and academically with <lb/> whites and also stay away from <lb/>
            large associations of Negroes <lb/> feel that they are recognized as <lb/> students -- not as "Negro" stu­-<lb break="no"/>­dents.
            As rapport develops be­-<lb break="no"/>tween these Negroes and their <lb/> white colleagues, race becomes <lb/> just another topic for
            dormitory <lb/> bull sessions and jests. <lb/> </p>
          <p> Two colored girls in <placeName>Wicomico</placeName> <lb/>

             <cb n="3"/>
             one day plastered Black Power signs all over their hall. “It was fun," reports prankster <persName>Carolyn</persName>,
             a freshman from <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, for in reply to this stunt, the white girls “dressed up in paper bags,
             pretending they were a <orgName>(Ku Klux) Klan</orgName>." </p>
          <p> The hooded WASPS sprinkled perfume on the floor in the shape of a cross and set fire to it. “It
            really startled us!" exclaimed <persName>Carolyn</persName>. </p>
          <p> "We kid around a lot in the dorm," related <persName>Bronwyn</persName>, a junior. "We sing 'We Shall overcome.’"
            Songs and jokes, she says, don’t offend her, for she does not "look on the bad side about what other
            people say about me." </p>
          <p> Some other Negro students find adjustment to <placeName>College Park</placeName> diffi­cult. <persName>Betty</persName>, who is 28 years old,
            married and a native of <placeName>Cali­fornia</placeName>, finds an “extremely hostile" attitude about the campus. “There are certain
            vibrations you can feel." </p>
          <p> <persName>Betty</persName> recalls an incident she had with an advisor. During registration week, she went to him twice with
            scheduling dilem­mas. “He was very nasty,"" she recalled, biting her lower lip and widening her very expressive
            eyes. “I told him I had to take this course. He threw my (drop­ add) slip at me...I thought it was
            terribly unprofessional for an advisor to extend this sort of treatment." </p>
          <p> <persName>Betty</persName> feels that her race did play a causative factor toward this discourteous treatment. “I
            do have a basis for comparison,"" she explained. She was raised in an integrated community, has
            traveled through <placeName>Europe</placeName> with her husband, attended <orgName>San Francisco State College</orgName> and <orgName>Hunter College</orgName>
            and interdated in her high school and earlier college years. </p>
            <ab rend="floating">'This is the first time I feel Negro'</ab>

              <cb n="4"/>
          <p> "I find It extremely difficult to estab­lish any form of communication with some of the teachers
            and advisors here," she said. “Students, basically, are friendly, receptive, and warm. But, in some
            instances, there is hesitancy...I don't think they know how to respond to a Negro." </p>
          <p> <persName>Betty</persName> has run into trouble securing rides from the commuters' carpool serv­ice. A few times, she was
            able to arrange rides over the telephone. However, when she met her future commuting companions they
            would frequently “begin to make excuses," and <persName>Betty</persName> had no ride. </p>
          <p> Resulting from her academic and social contacts, <persName>Betty</persName> concludes that, “When you are brought up in an
            inte­grated situation, you act as an individual. You are not Negro or white. But here...in the South...and
            on this campus...I feel I am treading on white man's territory...This is the first time I feel Negro." </p>
          <p> Also noting a discernible line between the races, but holding a different view­ point is a 28 year-old male
            student who works full time off campus. </p>
          <p> What's so overwhelming about feeling like a Negro, he questioned. “Isn't there a distinction" between
            Negroes and whites? </p>
          <p> With a wholly different frame of mind is <persName>Harry</persName>, a lively, congenial sophomore who commutes to school
            and takes photo­graphs for campus publications. “I am not a Negro on a white campus!" he asserts. </p>
          <p> "I don't think this is a white campus...and I don't go for this stuff that the Negro doesn’t have as
            much chance as everyone else out here. He does." </p>
          <p> A native of <placeName>Wisconsin</placeName> and formerly a nine-year resident of <placeName>Little Rock, Ark.</placeName>, <persName>Harry</persName> says,
            “Because of the way my family brought me up...I have never felt inferior to anybody. Some Negroes
            do feel inferior. Some feel mid way." </p>
          <p> A Negro who feels cunningly daring is <persName>Dave</persName>. <persName>Dave</persName> has skin brown as chocolate, teeth white as snow
            and a smile that signals immediate rapport with his environment. </p>
          <p> “Maryland is a conservative campus," he notes. “You can’t very well walk out of your race.
            I was told a lot of tales

              <cb n="5"/>
              before I came here. ‘You can’t do this. You can’t do that.’ I feel, though, that there is an
              atmosphere here and an opportunity to participate in just about anything." </p>
          <p> <persName>Dave</persName> has been active in dormitory sports, house rules committee, powder­ puff football, dormitory parties
            and homecoming preparations. </p>
          <p> Socially, <persName>Dave</persName> goes out with whites and Negroes. “I've gone steady with white girls, Jewish girls,"
            he said, adding, “I guess I am a gregarious fellow. I interrelate easily." “But I use my intellect
            before I jump. Every­ one gets slapped in the face a few times. So you use some discretion." </p>
          <p> In class, for example, “If your grade is tottering...and your prof talks with a little bit of a
            Southern accent...you don’t talk to <persName>Sally</persName> during the lecture." </p>
          <p> Two female Negro students, however, disagree with <persName>Dave</persName>’s classroom obser­vation. “If you prove yourself
            to the teacher," feels <persName>Bronwyn</persName>, “there is noth­ing the teacher can do against you." </p>
          <p> “I have encountered nothing (prejudi­cial) whatsoever,"" related <persName>Kathleen</persName>, a junior majoring in
            marketing and a transfer student from the <orgName>University of Maryland</orgName> in <placeName>Munich, Germany</placeName>. “I have yet to
            find an inkling that such a thing exists as far as teaching is concerned." </p>
          <p> <persName>Rich</persName>, a 26 year-old Business Student recalls, “There were a couple of courses I have taken here where
            I felt I had gotten a raw deal...I have only run across two professors I can really sit down and talk
            to here in BPA." </p>
          <p> <persName>Betty</persName>, the attractive housewife-student from <placeName>California</placeName> agrees. “I don’t expect to get the benefit
            of the doubt if I am borderline." </p>
          <p> Discussing classroom interaction among students, some Negroes find they are stared at if race is
            discussed during a lecture. Other Negroes notice nothing of the sort. </p>
          <p> "The kids don’t stare at me. They don’t even look up," laughed a pretty Junior who commutes to school from
            <placeName>Laurel</placeName>. “If they do, I don’t catch them staring!" </p>
          <p> “Sometimes it hits me that I am the only Negro in a class," relates another

              <cb n="6"/>
              Negro. "It doesn't make me shrink. I <lb/> am always working harder because I <lb/> always feel I have to prove
              myself to <lb/> white people. I have to show them that I <lb/> live as well as they do, maybe better. <lb/> I am not a dumb,
              ignorant Negro. I feel <lb/> that I have to prove this to them." <lb/> </p>
          <p> Though the Negroes on campus have <lb/>

              <cb n="7"/>
              different experiences and perceptions to <lb/> relate, they generally agree on one com­-<lb break="no"/>mon theme.
              As one freshman comment-<lb break="no"/>­ed, “When you have more and more <lb/> contact with Negro people, then you <lb/>
              don’t have as many preconceptions. Why? <lb/> Because the preconceptions all fall <lb/> apart." <lb/> </p>
