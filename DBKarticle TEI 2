           <byline>By Ira Allan</byline>
           <p> A militant black power soci­-<lb break="no"/>
             ology instructor ousted last sum­-<lb break="no"/>
             mer from the <orgName>Howard University </orgName><lb/>
             faculty told the campus <orgName>Congress <lb/>
             of Racial Equality</orgName> chapter last <lb/>
             night that Negro students at the <lb/>
             University ought to “begin ques­-<lb break="no"/>
             tioning the values" of a society <lb/>
             that has “brainwashed" them. <lb/>
             Speaking in the student union <lb/>
             before a crowd of about 100, <lb/>
             <persName>Nathan Hare</persName>, 26, said, “Black <lb/>
             power grows out of the schizoid <lb/>
             nature of a society where one <lb/>
             thing is professed and another <lb/>
             thing practiced. You should ques­-<lb break="no"/>
             tion the values of society and then <lb/>
             decide if you want to be a part <lb/>
             of it." <lb/> </p>
            <p> Hare said the black power <lb/>
             movement is stronger on many <lb/>
             white campuses than at <orgName>Howard</orgName>. <lb/>
             He said it was “the mental attitude <lb/>
             of social organizations and not <lb/>
             mere numbers" that determine <lb/>
             minority groups. <lb/> </p>
            <p> <persName>Hare</persName>, who taught sociology and <lb/>
             black power to <persName>Stokely Car­-<lb break="no"/>
             michael</persName>, past chairman of the <lb/>
             <orgName>Student Non-violent Coordinating <lb/>
             Committee</orgName> when both were at <lb/>
             <orgName>Howard</orgName>, was fired from his post <lb/>
             after leading student unrest at <lb/>
             the predominantly Negro univer­-<lb break="no"/>
             sity in <placeName>Washington</placeName>. <lb/> </p>
            <p> <persName>Hare</persName>, along with 19 other <lb/>
             teachers and students, was dis­-<lb break="no"/>
             missed after a series of inci­-<lb break="no"/>
             dents beginning last March when <lb/>
             Selective Service Director Lt. <lb/>
             Gen. <persName>Lewis Hershey</persName> was pre­-<lb break="no"/>
             vented from speaking on campus <lb/>
             by hecklers. Four students were <lb/>
             subsequently reinstated by a <lb/>
             federal court. <lb/> </p>
            <p> In June 1966, when <orgName>Howard</orgName> <lb/>
             was having its centennial obser­-<lb break="no"/>
             vation he was “told not to make <lb/>
             speeches or they (the adminis­-<lb break="no"/>
             tration) would clamp down." <lb/> </p>

             <cb n="2"/>

             <p> <persName>Hare</persName> made speeches. <lb/> </p>
             <p> Though noted as a firebrand, <lb/>
               the most revolutionary idea <persName>Hare</persName> <lb/>
               expressed was that “this group <lb/>
               <orgName>(CORE)</orgName> is big enough to virtual­-<lb break="no"/>
               ly take over this campus." <lb/>
               That declaration received a <lb/>
               mixed reaction from the group, <lb/>
               which last night initiated plans <lb/>
               for its second year on campus. <lb/>
               <orgName>CORE</orgName> President <persName>Earl Wynn</persName> <lb/>
               said the meeting was “a call for <lb/>
               unity among Negro students." <lb/>
               He hopes that activating the group <lb/>
               will help make the environment <lb/>
               at the University “conducive for <lb/>
               the social and educational ac­-<lb break="no"/>
               tivities of Negro students. <lb/>
               “It is time to stop talking and <lb/>
               to start action to prepare the <lb/>
               University to accept more <lb/>
               Negroes in the future," he de­-<lb break="no"/>
               clared. <lb/> </p>
              <p> <persName>Wynn </persName>said most Negro stu­-<lb break="no"/>
               dents, though they are not dis­-<lb break="no"/>
               criminated against on campus, <lb/>
               drop out or transfer to Negro <lb/>
               colleges as they “become dis­-<lb break="no"/>
               illusioned with the social life <lb/>
               at this University." <lb/> </p>
              <p> <persName>Wynn</persName> said, “Many are afraid <lb/>
               of alienating their white friends <lb/>
               so they imitate them." <lb/> </p>
              <p> The first part of the meeting <lb/>
               was a discussion of what <orgName>CORE'S</orgName> <lb/>
               aims and methods ought to be. <lb/>
               <persName>Wynn</persName> listed the following pri­-<lb break="no"/>
               orities: <lb/> </p>
              <p> • Establishment of black fra­-<lb break="no"/>
              ternities and sororities; <lb/> </p>
              <p> • Getting a course on Negro <lb/>
               history and culture into the aca­-<lb break="no"/>
               demic curriculum; <lb/> </p>
              <p> • Pressuring the administra­-<lb break="no"/>
              tion to hire more black pro­-<lb break="no"/>
              fessors; <lb/> </p>
              <p> • Integrating the cheerleading <lb/>
              squad. <lb/> </p>
              <p> “When the white players on <lb/>
              the team finish a good game, the <lb/>
              cheerleaders run out to hug and <lb/>
              kiss them. But when <persName>Bill (Jones)</persName> <lb/>

              <cb n="3"/>

              and <persName>Pete (Johnson)</persName> come off the <lb/>
              (basketball) court there’s nobody <lb/>
              to greet them. This may seem <lb/>
              a minute gripe to you, but to <lb/>
              them it's important." <lb/> </p>
              <p> Much of the comment from <lb/>
              members concerned the fact that <lb/>
              few University Negroes know <lb/>
              each other. <orgName>Wynn</orgName> said he hopes <lb/>
              to “make <orgName>CORE</orgName> a black grape­-<lb break="no"/>
              vine on campus and serve as a <lb/>
              liaison between the administra­-<lb break="no"/>
              tion and the Negro students." <lb/> </p>
